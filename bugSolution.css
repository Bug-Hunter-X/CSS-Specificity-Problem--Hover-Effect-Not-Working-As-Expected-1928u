The solution involves increasing the specificity of the `:hover` pseudo-class by making the selector more specific, ensuring it overrides other styles.

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
a:hover {
  color: red !important; /* Increased specificity using !important */
}

/* Unrelated styles, potentially adding to specificity conflict */
.container a {
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

Alternatively, use more specific selectors or restructure your CSS to avoid the conflict altogether.  For example, if possible, avoid using `!important` in favor of better selector organization.

**Note:** While `!important` solves the immediate problem, it's generally best to avoid it whenever possible, as it can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug.
