The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:hover` pseudo-class in conjunction with an element's default styling.  The hover effect doesn't apply as expected due to specificity issues.

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
a:hover {
  color: red;
}

/* Unrelated styles, potentially adding to specificity conflict */
.container a {
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

This is a common scenario, where the specificity of `.container a` could override the specificity of `a:hover` if an element with both classes is present, or nested within the `.container`.
